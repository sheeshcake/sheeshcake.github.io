                My life isnt so interesting but heres some lyrics of my favorite song for now;<p>Take me out tonight
                    Where there's music and there's people
                    And they're young and alive
                    Driving in your car
                    I never, never want to go home
                    Because I haven't got one
                    Anymore
                    Take me out tonight
                    Because I want to see people
                    And I want to see life
                    Driving in your car
                    Oh, please don't drop me home
                    Because it's not my home, it's their home
                    And I'm welcome no more
                    And if a double-decker bus
                    Crashes into us
                    To die by your side
                    Is such a heavenly way to die
                    And if a ten ton truck
                    Kills the both of us
                    To die by your side
                    Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine
                    Take me out tonight
                    Take me anywhere, I don't care
                    I don't care, I don't care
                    And in the darkened underpass
                    I thought, "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
                    But then a strange fear gripped me
                    And I just couldn't ask
                    Take me out tonight
                    Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care
                    I don't care, I don't care
                    Driving in your car
                    I never, never want to go home
                    Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum
                    Oh, I haven't got one</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Manila, Nov. 5, 1998- The peso closed at a 24-week high against the U.S. dollar yesterday after a
                    government official said the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas would refrain from intervention.

                    The local currency rose further 0.9 percent yesterday to end at P39.40 to the American currency, its
                    highest level since closing at P39.30=$1 on May 19. The peso reached an intra-day high of P39.155 to
                    the dollar. In the past month alone it had risen 11.7 percent against the dollar.

                    "The strengthening of our currency is a welcome relief for the nation,'' President Joseph Estrada's
                    spokesman Fernando Barican told reporters shortly before the currency market closed. "The peso rise
                    is the direct and natural result of market forces.''

                    He said the Monetary Board ``will not interfere in the continued appreciation of the peso in the
                    last few days.''

                    "The good performance of the peso in the foreign exchange market can be traced to the country's
                    sound macro-economic fundamentals and fiscal policies,'' Barican added.

                    President Estrada explained that the surging peso was an indication of the rising confidence in his
                    four-month-old administration.

                    "It is proof of business confidence, particularly foreign investors who are now convinced that our
                    economy is sound," he said in an interview over radio station DZRH.

                    Many financial analysts attribute the peso's strength to inflow of foreign currency into the
                    Philippines from foreign investors and the latest IMF approval of dollar loans to the Philippine
                    government.</p>

                <p>Yup, its my date of birth and that was the issue of the Philippines, when i came to earth.. :D</p>

                    meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray
                    gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                    stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear
                    the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable
                    forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own

                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                    see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>

                <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
                    looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
                    although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
                    samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a
                    picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
                    It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff
                    that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
                    window at the dull weather. </p>
